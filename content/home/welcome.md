I'm an MA student in the Linguistics Division of the Dept. of English at National Taiwan Normal University.

I seek to better understand how we human beings use language to transform thinking power into meaningful forces that have an impact on the world around us. I approach this question by using experimental methods based on psychology and neuroscience, as well as borrowing from philosophical theory.

I was born and raised in Singapore and have lived abroad in Thailand and Taiwan since 2015. To know more about me and my research aims, check out my my Bio page.

My research areas of interest include: Cognitive Linguistics, Cognitive Embodiment, Psycholinguistics, Cultural Semantics, Sociolinguistics, Philosophy of Mind, and Science and Technology Studies.
